/**
 * AI Gateway module for calling Base44's managed AI models from your own code.
 *
 * `connection()` hands you a `baseURL` and `token` that authenticate as your
 * Base44 app. An OpenAI-compatible client is any library, such as the `openai`
 * SDK or the Vercel AI SDK, that has the same request and response format
 * as OpenAI's Chat Completions API and lets you point it at a custom `baseURL`
 * instead of OpenAI's own servers. Pass `connection()`'s values to one of
 * these clients and it works against Base44's gateway exactly as it would
 * against the provider directly, no separate account, API key, or billing
 * setup with the underlying model provider required.
 *
 * Call `connection()` from a backend function rather than the browser. This
 * keeps your instructions, tools, and business logic server-side, and lets
 * you enforce your own auth, rate, and spend limits around the call. The
 * `token` it returns is the caller's regular session token, the same one
 * used for every other SDK call.
 *
 * ## Models
 *
 * You can use any of the [models available through `InvokeLLM`](/developers/references/sdk/docs/type-aliases/integrations#invokellm).
 * Pass `'automatic'` to let Base44 choose one, or pin a specific model such
 * as `'claude_sonnet_4_6'`, `'gpt_5_5'`, or `'gemini_3_1_pro'`.
 *
 * ## Authentication Modes
 *
 * There's no permission difference between modes. Both just determine which
 * token `connection()` returns:
 *
 * - **User authentication** (`base44.aiGateway`): Returns the signed-in app user's token.
 * - **Service role authentication** (`base44.asServiceRole.aiGateway`): Returns the service-role token instead, for calling the gateway when there's no signed-in user, such as from a scheduled automation.
 *
 * ## Billing and limits
 *
 * Requests are billed to your app's credit quota, which is the same shared
 * quota your app's built-in AI features use, and isn't split per user. If the
 * app runs out of credits, the gateway stops working for every user of the
 * app until the quota resets. A request is rejected before the model runs if
 * the app is out of credits. If you need to cap usage per user, build that
 * check yourself, for example by tracking calls per user in your own entity.
 *
 * Streaming responses aren't supported yet, so leave `stream` unset on your requests.
